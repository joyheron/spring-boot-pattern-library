This component is implemented using flexbox to give all children a consistent
margin regardless of the width or height of the child. This will be superceded
by the `gap: ...;` property as soon as that is also supported by Safari. (It's
already supported by all other modern browsers).

The template for this component uses the Thymeleaf layout dialect.
